Agents need instructions to follow. The better the instructions, the more likely the agent will be able to do something useful for/with their user.

Stripe has:

- LLM readable Docs (append .md to the end of any Docs)
- `search_stripe_documentation` tool built into our MCP server
- MCP Prompts

This folder is a folder of "prompts" synced with prompts on mcp.stripe.com. The syncing is done through a GitHub action.
