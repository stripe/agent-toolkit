## Tools

Use the Stripe Agent Toolkit to enable popular agent frameworks to integrate with Stripe APIs through function calling. The
library is not exhaustive of the entire Stripe API. It includes support for MCP, Python, and TypeScript and is built directly on top of the Stripe [Python][python-sdk] and [Node][node-sdk] SDKs.
